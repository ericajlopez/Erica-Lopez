About Me
I love to challenge myself to push code as often as I can.

Helping small businesses debut their presence online has been very fulfilling. 

Learning is my passion, and challenges are what keep me engaged. 

Outside of coding I enjoy collecting hobbies as well as their respective supplies which I just end up hoarding. Some of those include: collecting pokemon and mario figures, playing video games, sewing, home improvement, watching old school Spongebob episodes (those really help empty my mind), as well as many others.
